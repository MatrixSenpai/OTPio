OTP.io was built because apps like Google Authenticator havenâ€™t been updated in years. Some apps lack up-to-date features like the Today extension. Some just look plain old ugly.

OTP.io is designed to solve all that.

Features

- Show a 2FA (two-factor authentication) code
- Scan in a code from a provider, or allow you to add your own
- Get all your codes at a glance, just by swiping on the Lock Screen
