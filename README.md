# OTP.io
A TOTP code generator for the modern age

## What is this?
OTP.io is a [2FA](https://authy.com/what-is-2fa/) code generator. Scan a QR Code or enter an OTP url (`otpauth://`) to add a code.

## Why did you make it?
Most 2FA apps look ugly, or they haven't been updated for modern iOS devices. I wanted one that looked good, and did everything I wanted, all in one app. 
And maybe a few extra features on the side.

## What are the features?
- [ x ] Generate authentication codes from a QR code or OTP URL
- [   ] Today Extension
- [   ] Apple Watch App
- [   ] watchOS Complication
- [   ] Siri Extension
- [   ] Auto-fill Credentials Provider
