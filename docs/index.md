## Why Not Google Authenticator or another app?

I built OTP.io because apps like Google Authenticator haven't been updated in years. Some apps lack up-to-date features like the Today extension. Some just look plain old ugly.

OTP.io is designed to solve all that.

## What does it do?

OTP.io can

- Show a two-factor authentication code (2FA Token)
- Scan in a code from a 3rd party provider, or allow you to add your own
- Get all your codes at a glance, just by swiping on the Lock Screen
